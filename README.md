In this collaboration, we explored and ultimately visualized the temperature, weather, and humidity in the Addison over a one-year period. We chose to investigate the patterns between the temperature / humidity, and their impacts on the preservation and longevity of the art works in the museum. Once this was rendered, we then contrasted the patterns we saw there with patterns between the artwork degradation and the external temperature in the Andover area. 

After we had finished this assignment, I studied some of the other weather patterns in the Andover area out of interest
